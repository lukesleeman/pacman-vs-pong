pacman-vs-pong ==============


Pacman-vs-pong was a small javascript game created using the craftyjs gaming library.  The
game was inspired by an animated gif.  Pacman-vs-pong was a small hobby project.  Once it
was complete I posted it to reddit and much to my surprise it went viral, receiving over
70,000 hits in 24 hours.

The code is live at http://www.grafting-tool.com/pacmanvspong/

The live site contains a commercial CSS site template that I bought.  This repo contains
all of the non-commercial parts of the project, which I have the rights to redistribute.
